This is the .tex file of my master thesis "A GPU-Based Approach to accelerate the Pair-HMM Forward Algorithm for DNA Sequence Profile Alignment".
You can generate the PDF file by those file to read my master thesis!
cpu.cpp is the benchmark of the master thesis which is written by c++ and gpu.cu is the implementation of the gpu-based accelerate which is written by cuda and can be compile by nvcc library.
